table of contents overview
in an effort to advance the practice of security testing through adversary emulation and
adversarial engineering, we present this emulation plan to be used by an adversary emulation
team looking to emulate the threat group commonly known as apt3. the plan includes the
group s commonly known behavior through the tactics, techniques, and procedures (ttps) that
have been documented in publicly available threat reporting. to ground the plan in a common
taxonomy, it is based on the mitre att&ck model1. the scope of this emulation plan covers
the adversary lifecycle, beginning with initial network compromise and ending with exfiltration.
it discusses tools, methods, style, tradecraft, and end state objectives. historically, information
about attackers on-target actions and goals have been difficult to obtain and apt3 reporting is
no exception; however, the document bases instructions off publicly accessible sources whenever
possible, focusing on sources that could be cross-referenced to some degree. to fill the intel
gaps, the authors relied on their experience in threat intelligence and adversary emulation for
best-estimates.
threat reporting sources vary widely, and correlation of activity to a threat group is not
straightforward, and as such the authors have worked to ensure reputable sources are referenced.
while many threat intelligence sources work to provide information that is as accurate as
possible to the community, there is still an inherent risk that third-party threat reporting may
provide inaccurate information.
note: within this document, italicized text represents notes. these notes represent comments that
are not supported by evidence but represent the author s opinion. for example, they discuss
concessions that have been made to make the emulation instructions practical or to indicate
where inconsistent or nonexistent reporting has required gaps to be filled in with best-guess
estimates of adversary behavior.
references are indicated in-line with bracketed numbers [#] and listed at the end of this
document.
apt3 overview
att&ck group id: group/g0022
aliases: apt3, gothic panda, pirpi, ups team, buckeye, threat group-0110, tg-0110
operations: clandestine wolf, clandestine fox [1], operation double tap [2]
target industries: aerospace and defense, construction and engineering, high tech,
telecommunications, transportation [1]

adversary objectives: reporting indicates apt3 actors are interested in exfiltration of
documents [3]. they have been known to target printers and file shares [3]. they also target
intellectual property, often industrial in nature. [4].
background: apt3 is a china-based threat group. apt3 has traditionally targeted a myriad of
us and international targets; however, reporting dated september 2016 indicates the group
shifted focus around march 2016 to target hong kong organizations [3].
apt3 s process can be broken up into three main phases as shown below:
1. initial setup of command and control (c2), defense evasion techniques, and getting initial
compromise
2. discovery, privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence, and execution
3. collection, data staging, and exfiltration
figure 1 apt3's three phases of action
these phases are broken up into more detail in the following sections. the next section is about
the tools that apt3 uses for their operations, how to emulate them, and what att&ck tactics
and techniques they correspond to. command-line examples, as well as descriptions of what the
tools do, are included in the accompanying apt3 adversary emulation field manual for
reference.
2.1 apt3 tools
apt3 uses a combination of custom and openly available tools. because custom adversary tools
can have hidden functionality, be difficult to tailor to new environments, or utilize server-side
controllers which may be unavailable, recommendations are made for replacements that can
accurately perform similar activity. adversary emulators and defenders should be aware that2-3
replacement tools will typically leave different footprints than adversary tools, specifically
different file hashes, command line arguments, antivirus detection, api calls, and network
signatures. there are lots of ways to accomplish the same objectives with built-in windows
tools, but the focus for apt3 tends to be on more simplistic tools rather than more advanced
windows utilities like wmic, winrm, and powershell. the following table describes how to
emulate the tools as well as detailing which att&ck tactics are represented by them.

apt3 s custom tools provide a breadth of functionality. this section aims to break down these
custom tools from the table above a bit further into their specific functions and show how they
relate to att&ck, windows utilities, and toolkits that are open source and commercially
available.

emulation phases
apt3 disseminates spam-like phishing campaigns with various payload delivery methods [1].
once on a machine, the actors collect information about the victim such as connected users [14]
and analyze it for its value, trying to determine where they landed and what access they have.
admin access is an obvious main target due to the increased access it will likely provide. the
actors then drop multiple backdoors, usually 2-4 on the initial system and 5+ versions within the
first few hops, with independent c2 profiles for redundancy [redundant access t1108]. next
they then dump as many credentials as possible, and quickly continue spreading throughout the
network. they specifically go after file servers and print servers [1] [3]. once they re moved to
all the machines they think have value, they collect all the documents they want, package them
up and password protect them, and exfiltrate them out of the organization [15]. in some cases,
however, they ve been known to persist within a network for very lengthy periods without ever
exfiltrating data.
the sections below show how apt3 acts through their entire lifecycle. phase 1 documents what
happens during initial compromise, phase 2 highlights techniques used during network
propagation, and phase 3 documents one way they have been known to perform exfiltration.
3.1 phase 1 initial compromise
the goal of the initial compromise phase is to achieve successful code execution and control of
a system within the target environment.
apt3 primarily conducts initial compromise using spear phishing, delivering implants through
both malicious attachments and malicious links. they have used new 0-days on multiple
browsers [15]. they have targeted existing 0-days in internet explorer [2], windows [2], and
flash [14]. they have also been known to compromise weakly secured legitimate websites to
which users are directed through spear phishing emails [16].3-12
3.1.1 implant command and control
apt3 implants issue command and control (c2) traffic as http get requests that beacon at set
intervals [14]. the http cookie field contains information for the c2 server, which responds
with a webpage that contains the command encoded within a specific html tag [15]. apt3
implants have also been known to use custom binary protocols [2]. pirpi.2014 and pirpi.2015
both contain several kinds of sleep and anti-sandbox strategies that cause the rat to pause
between executions [15]. some of the pirpi instances have been known to also use ssl for their
communications and even include public/private keys within the binaries [17]. this level of c2
customization can be achieved with cobalt strike s malleable c2 profiles, as seen in the
accompanying malleable c2 profile modeled on [14].
3.1.2 defense evasion
many of apt3 s open source tools are customized or modified to prevent detection.
additionally, apt3 s malware uses a series of anti-disassembly techniques [3], including
requiring certain command line parameters to run [17]. these are defense evasion techniques that
apt3 sets up before getting initial access to the target environment.
it is recommended to use anti-antivirus (av) capabilities to prevent av detection of commonly
available tools. if sandboxing is a problem, possibly encrypt tools to bypass sandboxing. an
example of this would be veil-evasion [18] or artifact kit [19]. attack techniques: t1027 obfuscated files or information, t1045 software packing, t1066 indicator removal from
tools.
3.1.3 initial access
for initial compromise, both web server drive-by and malicious attachments are within apt3 s
tradecraft. the social engineering toolkit (free) [20] and cobalt strike (paid) [6] have features
that support these methods. case 1 spear phishing with browser exploit [2]
in late november 2014 an apt3 campaign used a spear phishing email (see appendix a)
containing a link to a malicious site. the site contained javascript that triggered cve-2014-6332
(an internet explorer exploit [21]) which launched a vbscript and powershell based payload.
the powershell script in turn downloaded and ran a stager which dropped two files, and . attempts to trigger cve-2014-4113 (a windows kernel exploit [22])
and run with the resultant elevated privileges. runs two commands: /c whoami
schtasks /create /tn "mysc" /tr c:\users\public\ /sc onlogon /ru "system"
the first command is used to check that the process is running as system. the second
establishes persistence via schtasks.3-13
in addition, the implant connected to a command and control server over port 1913 using the
socks5 protocol. this dropper supports writing to or executing files at the following locations: in addition, the software supports exfiltrating the file written at the following location [t1074 data staged]: in october 2014, a downloader like was observed to download pirpi. spear phishing with malicious rar attachment [3]
in attacks dating late 2015 to early 2016 apt3 has been known to use a zip archive containing a
windows shortcut file with an internet explorer logo. clicking on this link led to a download of
apt3 s pirpi rat. spear phishing with malicious rar attachment [7]
in attacks reported in june 2014, apt3 actors sent a rar archive as an email attachment. it
contained a resume and program purported to be written by the job candidate. the program, , contained a legitimate version of ttcalc but also dropped pirpi to:
%userprofile%/application and a bat file that was saved at [t1064 scripting]:
%userprofile%/start the bat file contained the following script:
@echo off /c start "c:\documents and settings\admin\application " updvamt
the bat file will be triggered when the user logged in and would have caused pirpi to start with
rundll32 [t1085 rundll32]. spear phishing with malicious rar attachment [7]
reported in june 2014, apt3 actors sent an encrypted self-extracting rar attachment. the
rar contained a trojanized setup program which attempts to drop and run another self-extracting rar which drops a dll version of the plugx rat at:
%allusersprofile%\chrome_frame_helper3-14
the rat is loaded via dll side-loading with a valid version of chrome [t1073 dll sideloading]. flash exploit with malware concealed within gif [14]
reported in 2015, two different apt3 campaigns targeted flash exploits, cve-2014-1776 and
cve-2015-3113. in both cases the flash exploit loaded the payload (the pirpi rat) from
specially crafted gif images. victim profiling [16]
reported in july 2015, apt3 used spear phising to direct targets to a compromised site. this site
had scanbox installed which was used to profile the victims and in some cases, deliver exploits
to selected victims.
3.2 phase 2 - network propagation
the goal of the network propagation phase is to identify and move to desired systems within the
target environment with the intention of discovering credentials and documents for exfiltration.
publicly reported direct observation of apt3 s network propagation techniques is almost nonexistent. one report that discusses general characteristics of apt3 is [23], but it is uncertain
what data sources were used to compile the listed ttps. aside from that report we draw
conclusions of how apt3 operates based on the capabilities of pirpi and other tools that they
are reported to use. there are some persistence techniques that they have used during initial
compromise that can be applied to network propagation. despite this, there are significant
gaps in the public knowledge of apt3 s tradecraft. where necessary we fill in details with best
guesses or recommendations.
the process within this phase can be described with the below diagram. each step within this
phase is broken out by att&ck tactic and the corresponding apt3 specific techniques
documented in reports. a command-line reference for emulating the specific att&ck
techniques with built-in windows utilities, cobalt strike, and metasploit can be found in the
accompanying apt3 adversary emulation field manual .3-15
3.2.1 host operations discovery
apt3 can perform discovery with its osinfo tool and by running built-in windows utilities on
the command-line using . based on the commands available in apt3 s toolset, there is a
lot of time spent enumerating domain groups with elevated permissions like domain admins , enterprise admins , and power users [t1069 - permission groups discovery]. there s also
figure 2 apt3 phase 2 flow chart3-16
a heavy emphasis on enumerating users in these special groups with the net user command
[t1087 account discovery].
when doing discovery, certain actions are very closely intertwined
(as shown grouped together in the above diagram). querying the
domain for the domain admins group [t1069 permission
groups discovery] returns the users that are members of that
group, which then involves looking up those users to see if they re
part of any other interesting groups [t1087 account discovery].
this process can repeat for a while as all interesting users and
groups are enumerated. similarly, querying systems for their
configuration [t1016 system network configuration discovery]
and their current network connections [t1049 system network
connections discovery] are heavily integrated. local privilege escalation
credential dumping and persistence may require local privilege escalation if the attacker does
not have control of a high integrity process; however, the
only reporting available on local privilege escalation
methods used by apt3 is cve-2014-4113 [2]. it is
possible that their strong reliance on credential access
(detailed later) allows them to use credentials with
increasing levels of access in place of other local
privilege escalation mechanisms. their perceived focus
during this phase, however, is on finding credentials that
allow direct admin permissions. in this case, control falls
through to credential access or persistence.
during an engagement, adversary emulators may find it
necessary to perform local privilege escalation due to
time constraints. most common frameworks (including metasploit and cobalt strike) contain
some methods for privilege escalation. also, uacbypass [24] and powerup [9] are common and
freely available tools that may be used to perform privilege escalation.

att&ck techniques
figure 4 apt3 privilege escalation
att&ck techniques3-17 persistence
apt3 has used multiple methods for persistence: creating a
service [23] (t1050 - new service), creating a scheduled task
[2] (t1053 - scheduled task), and also by placing scripts in the
startup folder [7] [t1060 - registry run keys/start folder].
apt3 has replaced the sticky keys binary
( ) with [t1015 -
accessibility features] and enabled remote desktop protocol
(rdp) if it is not already enabled [t1076 remote desktop
protocol]. this specific persistence technique has an added
benefit of allowing an operator to open a command prompt
when connected over rdp without having to provide valid
credentials [23].
apt3 has been known to create or enable accounts, for
example support_388945a0 , and add them to the local admin
group [23] [t1136 create account]. presumably this is done
for easier future access.
recommendation: on new hosts, establish persistence by creating a
service or schtasks. on systems where rdp capabilities are desired,
it might also be useful to enable sticky keys and rdp. credential access
apt3 uses many forms of credential access. they used
customized versions of pwdump, and later a custom
compiled version of mimikatz, to search for cached
windows credentials [t1003 - credential dumping] as well
as chromepass and lazagne [(t1081 - credentials in
files], to search though browser and other credential
caches. their pwdump tool injects itself into and
is executed by running the gethash export of the [3] mimikatz is used to dump plaintext
credentials by injecting into . [t1003 - credential
dumping].
they also install a keylogger, which can be used to
discover credentials and remote systems [t1056 - input
capture]. this keylogger installs itself as a service and
records keystrokes in encrypted files such as
thumbcache_96.dbx [t1027 obfuscated files or
information] [3].

3.2.2 lateral movement
though publicly reported information on how apt3
enumerates machines aside from related commands in
apt3 s tools, they ve been known to use net view and
dsquery to do so. this may be due to a lack of available
information on how apt3 operates during an operation
since most reports tend to be focused on forensic
information. pirpi has commands that list servers in the
domain, list tcp connections and retrieve connected users
(t1049 - network connections discovery), and list domain
controllers (t1018 - remote system discovery). some of
this information may be used to identify target hosts for
lateral movement. in addition to built-in windows utilities,
there are some open source tools which collect similar
information. apt3 will quickly spread to other machines as
fast as possible, often checking for easy password reuse by
trying to mount shares from other machines via net use [t1078 valid accounts] [t1077 - windows admin
shares] [t1110 brute force].
apt3 prioritizes file and printer servers.
remote copy and execution
apt3 uses a custom tool called remotecmd that can run
commands on a remote system. it s not clear what
protocol(s) are being used, but remotecmd supports file
operations (upload, download, delete and rename) service
operations (creation, deletion, start and stop) and scheduled
tasks (at,schtasks). presumably these are done over smb (files), remote service (services) and
remote schtasks (at).

3.3 phase 3 - exfiltration
it s likely that apt3 will compromise a
network to a certain degree of satisfaction
before starting to exfil, due to stealth
concerns. depending on the defensive setup,
exfiltration could be much noisier and
noticeable than attempting to hide in the
noise with lay-of-the-land tools.
the only source we were able to find for
apt3 exfiltration methods is from 2012. for
exfiltration, they will identify office
documents on the computer [23] [t1005 -
data from local system]. they then drop the
command-line chinese language version of
winrar and use it to compress and encrypt the discovered documents [t1002 - data
compressed]. this archive will then be stored in the recycle bin [23], usually on a machine
designated as a staging server, which they move the exfiltration through [t1074 - data staged].
data is exfiltrated over port 443 which is typically https traffic, however they have used ssl
encryption [17] and normal http [23] [t1043 - commonly used port] .
