overview
lazarus has been a major threat actor in the apt arena for several years. alongside goals like cyberespionage and cybersabotage, the attacker has been targeting banks and other financial companies around the globe. over the last few months, lazarus has successfully compromised several banks and infiltrated a number of global cryptocurrency exchanges and fintech companies. kaspersky lab has been assisting with incident response efforts. while investigating a cryptocurrency exchange attacked by lazarus, we made an unexpected discovery. the victim had been infected with the help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been recommended to the company over email. it turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a third-party application from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware known as fallchill, an old tool that lazarus has recently switched back to. there have been multiple reports on the reappearance of fallchill, including one from us-cert. to ensure that the os platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets, it seems the attackers went the extra mile and developed malware for other platforms, including for macos. a version for linux is apparently coming soon, according to the website. it s probably the first time we see this apt group using malware for macos. the fact that the lazarus group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call for users of non-windows platforms. trojanized cryptocurrency trading application
thanks to kaspersky lab s malicious-behavior detection technology, implemented in its endpoint security software, we were able to reassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin. this helped us understand that one of lazarus victims was infected with malware after installing a cryptocurrency trading program. we also confirmed that the user installed this program via a download link delivered over email. trojanized trading application for windows
including malicious code into distributed software and putting that on a website would be too obvious. instead, the attackers went for a more elaborate scheme: the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an update for a trading application. a legitimate-looking application called celas trade pro from celas limited showed no signs of malicious behaviour and looked genuine. this application is an all-in-one style cryptocurrency trading program developed by celas. when we started this research, any user could download the trading application from the celas website. checking the installation package downloaded from the website confirmed the presence of a very suspicious updater. at the end of the installation process, the installer immediately runs the module with the checkupdate parameter. this file looks like a regular tool and most likely will not arouse the suspicion of system administrators. after all, it even contains a valid digital signature, which belongs to the same vendor. but the devil is in the detail, as usual. the code writer developed this project under the codename jeus , which was discovered in a pdb path included in the updater and used as unique http multipart message data separator string. because of this, and the fact that the attacked platforms include apple macos, we decided to call this operation applejeus. properties of the shady updater tool included in the package are: the main purpose of is to collect the victim s host information and send it back to the server. upon launch, the malware creates a unique string with the format string template %09d-%05d based on random values, which is used as a unique identifier of the infected host. this malware collects process lists, excluding [system process] and system processes and gets the exact os version from the registry value at hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion . it seems that such values only exist from windows 10, so we assume that the author developed and tested it on windows 10. data encryption routine the code sends the victim s information to a webserver using http and the following url: the server is a legitimate looking website owned by the developer of the program: celas llc. at this point we were not able to conclude with high confidence whether the server was compromised by the threat actor or had belonged to the threat actor from the beginning. to learn more about the server, please read the infrastructure section below. the malware used a hardcoded user-agent string mozilla/5.0 (compatible; msie 10.0; windows nt 6.1; trident/6.0) and fixed a multipart form data separator string jeus . using encryption, the custom separator string wouldn t be a red flag for a legitimate application, but sending a request with the context-irrelevant string get_config , as well as uploading collected system information as , mimicking a gif image with a magic number in the header, definitely made us raise our eyebrows. communication with the c2 server after successfully uploading data, the updater checks the server response. if the server responds with http code 300, it means the updater should keep quiet and take no action. however, if the response is http code 200, it extracts the payload with base64 and decrypts it using rc4 with another hardcoded key ( w29ab@ad%df324v$yd ). the decrypted data is an executable file that is prepended with the max_pathjeusd string. during our research, we found other similar files. one was created on august 3rd and another on august 11th. the pdb path shows that the author keeps improving this updater tool, apparently forked from some stable version released on july 2, 2018 according to the internal directory name. trojanized trading program for macos
for macos users, celas llc also provided a native version of its trading app. a hidden autoupdater module is installed in the background to start immediately after installation, and after each system reboot. it keeps contacting the command and control (c2) server in order to download and run an additional executable from the server. the communication conforms to the windows version of the updater and is disguised as an image file upload and download, while carrying encrypted data inside. we have analyzed the following installation file: once the cellas trade pro app is installed on macos, it starts the updater application on the system load via a file named .com.celastradepro.plist (note that it starts with a dot symbol, which makes it unlisted in the finder app or default terminal directory listing). the updater file is passed the checkupdate parameter on start. celas trade pro app plist file (apple property list) the command-line argument checkupdate looks redundant from a code analysis perspective: there is no other argument that the application expects. in the absence of all arguments, it doesn t do anything and quits. this may or may not be way to trick sandboxes that could automatically execute this trojan updater, with no suspicious activity produced without such a secret extra argument. the choice of a benign string such as checkupdate helps it to hide in plain sight of any user or administrator looking into running processes. the trojanized updater works similar to the windows version in many ways. both applications are implemented using a cross-platform qt framework. upon launch, the downloader creates a unique identifier for the infected host using a %09d-%06d format string template. next, the app collects basic system information, which for macos is done via dedicated qt classes: host name
os type and version
system architecture
os kernel type and version
the process of encrypting and transferring data is the same as in the windows version. this information is xor-encrypted with hardcoded 16-byte static key moz&wie;#t/6t!2y , prepended with gif89a header and uploaded to the c2 server via http post and the following url: https://www.celasllc[.]com/checkupdate.php post request template strings the module relies on a hardcoded user-agent string for macos:
user-agent: mozilla/5.0 (macintosh; intel mac os x 10_12_6) applewebkit/537.36 (khtml, like gecko) chrome/66.0.3359.139 safari/537.36 once the server replies, it checks the http response code. http response code 300 indicates that the server has no task for the updater and the application terminates immediately. if the http response is code 200, then the updater gets the data in the response, decodes it from base64 encoding and decrypts it using rc4 with the hardcoded static key w29ab@ad%df324v$yd . it calculates the md5 of the decoded and decrypted data, which is compared to a value stored inside, to verify the integrity of the transferred file. after that, the payload is extracted and saved to a hardcoded file location /var/zdiffsec , sets executable permissions for all users and starts the app with another secret hardcoded command-line argument bf6a0c760cc642 . apparently the command-line argument is the way to prevent the detection of its malicious functionality via sandboxes or even reverse engineering. we have previously seen this technique adopted by lazarus group in 2016 in attacks against banks. as of 2018, it is still using this in almost every attack we investigated. downloaded payload
according to data from kaspersky security network, the threat actor delivered the malicious payload using one of the shadowy updaters described above. we found a malicious file created at the same host: note the unusually large size for an executable file. we believe that it was inflated with junk data on purpose to prevent easy download or transfer over the internet. searching for the reason for the malware s appearance on the system revealed that there was an additional process responsible for producing several files before this malware was launched, suggesting a trojan dropper in action. the main function of this malware is to implant the fallchill backdoor loader linked to several files. upon launch, the malware checks one of the command-line arguments passed to it. the malware chooses one of the service names located in the following registry value as a disguise: hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\svchost\netsvcs this value includes a list of several dozen standard system service names. the randomly chosen service name is used to name the dropped file and newly registered windows service. let s refer to this randomly chosen service name as [service]. the malware contains references to several files inside: a mix of the above-mentioned files produces the final backdoor known as fallchill. a more detailed procedure for technical specialists is as follows: check whether the command-line argument points to a file of 16 byte size.
read the file passed via the command-line argument. the contents of this file contains a crypto key, which we will call the main key.
open the file (configuration file). if the file size equals 192 bytes, read the content of the file.
open file and decrypt it using the main key.
create the file and fill it with pseudo-random data.
the malware fills the file with 10,240 bytes of pseudo-random data, and iterates (rand() % 10 + 10240) times. this is why it produces files which are at least 104,851,000 bytes.
copy the 16-byte main key at the end of the file.
encrypt the file name with the main key and append it at the end of .
overwrite the beginning of with data decrypted from .
move file to .
delete temporary files: , , .
timestamp and files.
register as a windows service.
save a copy of data from file in the following registry value
hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\taskconfigs\description. infection process diagram fallchill backdoor loader
we confirmed that the following malware was created on the infected host using the method described above: upon starting, reads 276 bytes from the end of its own executable file. the first 16 bytes of this 276-byte data are used as a decryption key, and the remaining 260 bytes contain the encrypted file path used by the backdoor. data at the end of the loader module after decryption of the last 260-bytes, the malware retrieves the name or path of the file that contains the actual backdoor body in encrypted form. decrypted file name in the end of loader module the malware reads the specified file and decrypts it using the same decryption routine. this is how the executable code of the backdoor is produced in memory and executed by the loader. below is the meta information about the decrypted final payload in memory: we can summarize the fallchill backdoor loading process as follows: loading the fallchill backdoor as mentioned previously, the final payload belongs to a fallchill malware cluster formerly attributed to the lazarus apt group. upon launching, this malware resolves the api function addresses at runtime, and reads the c2 server address from the registry value created during the installation stage:
hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\taskconfigs\description if there is no configuration value, the malware falls back to a default c2 server address. this is a full-featured backdoor that contains enough functions to fully control the infected host. some of its network protocol commands are described below.
this set of capabilities is very common for many lazarus backdoors, which have been seen in other attacks against banks and financial industry in the past years. infrastructure
while working on the incident of the cryptocurrency company s breach, we were curious about the legal status of the celas llc company that developed this trojanized trading application. celas llc main homepage. the website had a valid ssl certificate issued by comodo ca. however, note that the certificate from this webserver mentions domain control validated , which is a weak security verification level for a webserver. it does not mean validation of the identity of the website s owner, nor of the actual existence of the business. when certification authorities issue this kind of certificate they only check that the owner has a certain control over the domain name, which can be abused in certain ways.
it looks at first sight like a legitimate whois record, but something doesn t really add up here. the domain was the only domain registered with this email address and was exclusively used for domain registration. the registrant used the domain4bitcoins service to register this domain, apparently paying with cryptocurrency. according to open-source intelligence, the address of the whois information is fake, unless it s the owner of a ramen shop running a cryptocurrency exchange software development studio on the side. view of the location referred in the whois record. image source: google maps. the server hosting ( ) belongs to the blackhost isp in the netherlands. whois record of server coincidentally, the fallchill malware authors also preferred to use the same hosting company to host their c2 server. moreover, the celas llc web server and one of the c2 servers of the fallchill malware are located in the same network segment of this isp: however, when you look into celas trading pro application s digital signature, including its updater , you will find that this certificate was also issued by comodo ca, which refers to a company address in the united states. overlap of c2 infrastructure apparently, the attackers using the fallchill malware continue to reuse code and c2 server infrastructure over and over again. according to kaspersky security network, fallchill was not the only malware used in this attack. there was another backdoor that was used by the threat actor. we omit a full description of this backdoor in the current report to keep the write-up to an acceptable length, but we would like to highlight two important things discovered in it. first, this backdoor was created on 2018-07-12 and revealed an already familiar directory, tmanager , which we previously saw in the application from the cellas trading pro suite: second, what is probably one of the most interesting findings to come from this additional backdoor was discovered hidden in hardcoded headers used to communicate with c2 server. the accept-language http header string revealed a language code associated with north korea. in our experience, this is something we normally don t see in malware. accept-language http header value in the body of the backdoor conclusions
the lazarus apt group s continuous attacks on the financial sector are not much of a surprise to anyone. a lot of research has been done and published about such attacks. however, we think this case makes a difference. recent investigation shows how aggressive the group is and how its strategies may evolve in the future. first of all, lazarus group has entered a new platform: macos. there is steadily growing interest in macos from ordinary users, especially in it companies. many developers and engineers are switching to using macos. apparently, in the chase after advanced users, software developers from supply chains and some high profile targets, threat actors are forced to have macos malware tools. we believe that in the future lazarus is going to support all platforms that software developers are using as a base platform, because compromising developers opens many doors at once. we cannot say with full certainty whether celas llc was compromised and the threat actor abused it to push malware through an update mechanism. however, the multiple successful lazarus attempts to compromise supply chain companies suggest that it will keep exploring this infection method. from all angles, the celas llc story looks like the threat actor has found an elaborate way to create a legitimate looking business and inject a malicious payload into a legitimate looking software update mechanism. sounds logical: if one cannot compromise a supply chain, why not to make fake one? this should be a lesson to all of us and a wake-up call to businesses relying on third-party software. do not automatically trust the code running on your systems. neither good looking website, nor solid company profile nor the digital certificates guarantee the absence of backdoors. trust has to be earned and proven. stay safe!
